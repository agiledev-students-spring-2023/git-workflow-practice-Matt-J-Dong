This article talks about Tesla, and its Autopilot and FSD (Full Self Driving) software. These pieces of software have recently come under scrutiny for a couple reasons, including false advertising and possible safety concerns. Elon Musk has repeated touted the capabilities of the software, and the name "Full Self Driving" suggests that the vehicle can drive itself. However, the technology is nowhere near perfect, and to be safe drivers would still need to be able to take control at any time and with their hands on the wheel.
Self-driving software is generally regarded as something that will be present within the future of humanity, as a way to safely, cheaply, and effectively get people from one place to another. Personally I believe that it will improve the standard of living of many people after it becomes fully operational. However, it will still take another couple years at least before we reach the point where autonomous vehicles are the ones driving us on the roads.

Comment (James Chen jyc8938) I also found this article really interesting. I was under the impression that Tesla's self driving software should have been thoroughly tested and safe, but it seems like the company has intentionally oversold its abilities.
